# 🚀 Event Frequency Improvements

## ⚡ **Dramatically Increased Event Frequency**

The application now generates events **3-4x faster** than before, providing much more activity and real-time data flow.

## 📊 **Event Timing Changes**

### **Before vs After Comparison**

| Event Type | Previous Delay | New Delay | Speed Increase   |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| **SEARCH** | 800ms          | **200ms** | **4x faster**    |
| **VIEW**   | 1200ms         | **300ms** | **4x faster**    |
| **BOOK**   | 1500ms         | **400ms** | **3.75x faster** |
| **CANCEL** | 4000ms         | **800ms** | **5x faster**    |

### **Expected Event Rates**

With the new timing, you can expect:

- **SEARCH events**: ~5 per second (was ~1.25/sec)
- **VIEW events**: ~3.3 per second (was ~0.83/sec)
- **BOOK events**: ~2.5 per second (was ~0.67/sec)
- **CANCEL events**: ~1.25 per second (was ~0.25/sec)

**Total**: ~**12 events per second** (was ~3 events/sec)

## 🎯 **Enhanced Monitoring for High Frequency**

### **Adjusted Reporting Intervals**

- **Metrics reporting**: Every 2000 events (was 1000) to handle higher volume
- **Analytics windows**: 30-second summaries (was 60s) for more frequent updates
- **Event sampling**: Every 50 events logged (was 100) for better visibility
- **Console sampling**: 5% of non-booking events shown (was 2%)

### **What You'll See**

With the increased frequency, expect to see:

```bash
🎯 BOOK | User: user_003 | Destination: Tokyo | Price: $245.67
📝 SEARCH | User: user_007 | Destination: Paris | Price: $189.23  [Sample]
🎯 BOOK | User: user_001 | Destination: London | Price: $298.45
🎯 BOOK | User: user_009 | Destination: Dubai | Price: $156.78
💡 SUGGESTION | User: user_003 | Destination: Tokyo | Confidence: 87.3% | Hotels: 4
📝 VIEW | User: user_005 | Destination: Barcelona | Price: $167.89  [Sample]
🎯 BOOKING CONFIRMED: user_001 → London
📊 === 30s SUMMARY === Total: 347 | Bookings: 142 (40.9%) | Searches: 104 | Views: 78 | Cancels: 23
📊 Event Generation Metrics - 2000 events (823 bookings), Rate: 11.8 events/sec, Booking Rate: 41.2%
```

## 🔥 **Performance Impact**

### **Positive Effects**

- **More realistic simulation**: Higher activity resembles real-world booking platforms
- **Faster suggestion generation**: Users reach suggestion thresholds quicker
- **Better analytics**: More data points for windowed calculations
- **Increased booking volume**: More bookings per minute for testing

### **System Handling**

- **Async logging**: Prevents I/O bottlenecks
- **Smart sampling**: Maintains visibility without overwhelming console
- **Efficient aggregation**: Custom aggregators handle high-volume analytics
- **Optimized checkpointing**: 5-second intervals handle the increased throughput

## 📈 **Expected Metrics**

With the new frequency, expect these approximate rates:

```
📊 30-second windows: ~360 events per window
📊 Booking rate: ~40-60% (maintained from previous improvements)
📊 Events per second: ~12 (4x increase from ~3/sec)
📊 Suggestions generated: More frequent due to faster user activity accumulation
```

## 🎮 **Usage**

Simply run the application - it will now generate events much more frequently:

```bash
java -jar target/booking-suggestion-1.0.0.jar
```

You'll immediately notice:

- **Much more console activity**
- **Faster booking confirmations**
- **More frequent analytics summaries**
- **Quicker suggestion generation**

## 🔍 **Monitoring High-Frequency Events**

```bash
# Watch the high-frequency event stream
tail -f logs/events.log

# Monitor rapid booking confirmations
tail -f logs/events.log | grep "BOOK"

# Check performance with high volume
tail -f logs/metrics.log

# View frequent analytics updates
tail -f logs/analytics.log
```

---

**Result**: **4x faster event generation** with smart monitoring and maintained system stability! ⚡🎉
